## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Budget Management**: Create, edit, and delete budgets with customizable names and amounts
- **Expense Tracking**: Add income and expense entries with detailed categorization
- **Visual Analytics**: View spending patterns with interactive pie charts and metrics
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in English and Spanish

### Smart Features
- **🤖 AI Receipt Scanning**: Use Google Gemini AI to extract transaction details from receipt images and PDFs
- **🏷️ Automatic Categorization**: Entries without a category ("Sin categoría") can be categorized from their description on request: the metrics screen asks first, and only descriptions are sent

- **🏦 Multi-Bank Support**: Configurable SMS parsing for different bank formats
- **📊 Real-time Metrics**: Track spending by category with visual breakdowns

### Technical Features
- **Cross-Platform**: Shared codebase for Android and iOS with Kotlin Multiplatform
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Adaptive UI that follows system preferences
- **Offline-First**: Local SQLite database with SqlDelight for reliable data storage
- **Modern UI**: Built with Compose Multiplatform for a smooth, native experience on both platforms
- **Real-time Updates**: Reactive UI with StateFlow and Compose integration
- **Configurable AI Processing**: One toggle in settings turns receipt scanning and automatic categorization on/off (kept on your account)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### For Android Development
- Android Studio Koala or later with Kotlin Multiplatform plugin
- JDK 17 (required)
- Android SDK with:
  - minSdk: 26
  - targetSdk: 36
  - compileSdk: 36

#### For iOS Development
- macOS with Xcode 14.0 or later
- CocoaPods (for iOS dependencies)
- iOS 14.0+ for deployment target

#### Required API Keys
- Google Gemini API key (for AI-powered receipt scanning)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevinmeneses/BudgetHunter.git
   cd BudgetHunter
   ```

2. **Set up API Keys**
   Create a `local.properties` file in the root directory:
   ```properties
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Build and run**

   **For Android:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

   **For iOS:**
   ```bash
   # Open the iOS project in Xcode
   open iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj
   # Then build and run from Xcode
   ```

```

### Automatic categorization
New entries start as "Sin categoría". When AI processing is on, opening the metrics screen of a synced budget with
uncategorized entries asks whether to categorize them; on confirm the app uploads pending entries, the backend
categorizes them (keyword rules, then a cache, then Gemini Flash-Lite, using only the description) and the app
refreshes the chart. Entries that already have a category are never changed. Details:
[`docs/plans/auto-categorization.md`](docs/plans/auto-categorization.md).

Each feature module follows **Clean Architecture** with:
- `application/` - ViewModels and presentation logic
- `data/` - Repository implementations and data sources
- `domain/` - Business logic and use cases
- `ui/` - Compose UI components
